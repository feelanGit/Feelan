## A Decentralised AI


### We are in early phase

The app has a frontend built with react and two backends, blockchain (react) and AI (flask).
These are deployed on Google cloud run. 

The repository contains the source code of the fronend and blockchain side. 


### Crypto

The chat data is encrypted with Lit protocol and stored on Arweave permanent storage through Irys nodes (testnet). 
We are currently storing on testnet - data is deleted after 90 days. 
Moreover at the moment the app stores chat data on cloud, required during a period of transition to full blockchain. 

It's possible to mint the chat as NFT on Polygon Mumbai (testnet).




### AI

At this stage the source code of the AI side is not shared publically for security and integrity of the app. 

The AI is a zephyr-7b-beta model which is a finetuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1. 

### Near term development

- Managing the git repo.
- Add security to the API calls.

### Crypto near-term development

- The possibility to chat with other users.
- Minting single messages within a chat - nested NFTs.
- Smart accounts.
